## About me
I am a PhD candidate in Information and Communication Technologies (DIMES, University of Calabria) researching wearable technologies for active and healthy ageing. My work spans physiological-signal analysis, affective computing, cognitive neuroscience, multimodal fusion, and machine learning for real-time personalized health systems. I combine rigorous experimental design with ML/DL methods to extract biomarkers of cognitive and emotional states.

---

## Research interests
- Physiological signal analysis (EEG, PPG, GSR, ECG, EMG)  
- Affective computing & emotion recognition  
- Cognitive neuroscience & biomarkers for healthy ageing  
- Wearable/mobile health monitoring and brain–computer interfaces (BCI)  
- Multimodal fusion, representation learning, transformers, autoencoders

---

## Snapshot — What I do
- Design and analyze multimodal biomedical signal recording protocols (EEG, GSR, PPG, ECG, EMG, respiration).  
- Develop ML/DL pipelines (TensorFlow / PyTorch) for brain-signal decoding, fatigue/stress detection, and personality/affect modeling.  
- Validate experimental protocols and perform neuroimaging analyses (EEG source localization, connectivity, brain–behavior correlations).  
- Mentor students, supervise projects, and support lab teaching and curriculum delivery.
